# 🧠 Portfolio Backend - REST API

This is the **backend API** for my personal portfolio dashboard. It powers blog management, project tracking, experience records, skillsets, resume uploads, and more. Built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, this backend handles all the core data operations and exposes secure endpoints for frontend consumption.
